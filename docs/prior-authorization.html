<h1>Prior Authorization</h1>

<p>Prior Authorization is a clinical review process used by PBMs to ensure certain medications are appropriate, safe, and medically necessary before they are approved for coverage. Drugs that are high-cost, specialty, or have specific use criteria often require PA. The prescriber or pharmacy must submit clinical documentation, which is evaluated against established guidelines. Only after approval can the claim be paid; otherwise, the claim rejects with a PA-required message.</p>
