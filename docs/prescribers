<h1>Prescribers</h1>

<p>The Prescribers module manages information about healthcare providers authorized to write prescriptions. It stores key details such as NPI number, name, specialty, address, and licensing information. PBM systems use this data to validate prescription claims and ensure the provider is active and eligible. The module also supports flagging prescribers for restrictions, fraud monitoring, or network rules.</p>
