<h1>Coordination of Benefits</h1>

<p>Coordination of Benefits is the process of determining payment responsibility when a member has multiple insurance plans. PBMs use COB rules to identify the primary and secondary payer and apply proper pricing and reimbursement logic. The module handles BIN/PCN configurations, block lists, and messaging for COB-related claim outcomes. This ensures accurate payment distribution and prevents duplicate or excessive reimbursement.</p>
