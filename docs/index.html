<h1>PBM knowledge base</h1>

<h2>Claim</h2>

The PBM system validates the claim against eligibility, formulary rules, pricing logic, copay/accumulator settings, and coverage restrictions to determine whether it is approved, rejected, or requires prior authorization.</p>

<h2>Formulary</h2>
<p>A **formulary** in the PBM domain is a curated list of medications covered by a health plan, organized into tiers based on cost and clinical value. It helps control drug spending while ensuring safe and effective therapy options for members. Each tier has different copay or coinsurance levels, and some drugs may require prior authorization or step therapy.</p>
