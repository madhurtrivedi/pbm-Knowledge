<h1>Providers</h1>
<p>Providers in a PBM system are healthcare professionals or entities—such as physicians, clinics, hospitals, and pharmacies—that deliver medical or pharmacy services to members covered under a health plan. In the PBM ecosystem, providers play a key role by prescribing medications, submitting claims, and interacting with the PBM’s rules, formularies, and benefit designs. PBMs validate provider credentials, apply network rules, determine reimbursement, and ensure that only authorized and contracted providers can service members. Provider data—such as NPI, DEA, specialty, and network status—is essential for accurate claim adjudication, fraud prevention, and regulatory compliance.</p>
